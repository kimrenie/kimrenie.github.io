# What is DynamoDB? (48 words)

![dynamo-db](/images/dynamo-db.png)

Amazon DynamoDB is an AWS service that allows users to create key-value NoSQL databases that are fully managed by AWS. These databases use a serverless framework because they work in conjunction with AWS's resources and only require the client to pay for the services that are actively used.

# Comparisons to MongoDB (119 words)

| | MongoDB | DynamoDB |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Basics | Uses a traditional, server-based database | Uses a service-based database |
| Security | Data security relies on keeping up a consistent TCP connection in order to protect the database from the public internet | database access is processed through the DynamoDB API rather than HTTPS network connection. This method uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions in order to authorize connection with clients. This process also reduces latency. |
| Operations model | Mongo requires its software to be installed on each instance that it is used on on. Subsequently, this increases the memory and storage that is needed overall. | Dynamo handles the instance management and the user is only responsible for the ammount of usage that their application actively uses. |

        A partition is an allocation of storage for a table that is automatically replicated across multiple AZs within an AWS Region.

        Partition management is handled entirely by DynamoDBâ€”you never have to manage partitions yourself.

Some of the relevant operations that can be used when working with the mongo shell are as follows:

    > mongo                     # this connects the server to mongo shell
    > help
    > show dbs                  # this displays all the of the available databases 

# Prerequisites

In order to properly run DynamoDB on your machine, the following softwares need to be installed:

- Node.js
' # node -v '
- an AWS profile
- serverless framework
