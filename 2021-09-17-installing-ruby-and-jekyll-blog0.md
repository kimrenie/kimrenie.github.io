# Installing Ruby

In conjunction to our usage of Github in this class, we are able to utilize GitHub pages as the host of our website through the """" um ?"""""""" of a static site generator named Jekyll.

Because Jekyll is an installable Ruby Gem, first you would need to install Ruby. First, you would need to download the latest version of Ruby for your device.....

Some relevant Ruby terminology would include:

1. Gems

   > A gem is a *Library* that you can install and call for usage in your projects or applications. New gems can be found amongst Ruby's open source gem community or through other third-party librarys. The term *gem* came purely out of the fact that it is a pun along side the term *Ruby*. lol

``` 
bundle exec jekyll serve 
```
This command helped to locally view the changes I was actively making rather than having to `git push` and publish my edits.
